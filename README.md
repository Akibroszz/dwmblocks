# dwmblocks

dwmblocks is a modular status bar for dwm written in C.
This repository is my build of dwmblocks.

# Installing dwmblocks

Clone this repository then run ``make`` and then install it with ``sudo make install``.
After that you'll need to launch it, either use xinitrc or if you use the autostart patch for dwm you can put it there.
